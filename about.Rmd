- Visit [**Prepreocessing**](Vignettes/dp.html) tab to see the workflow up to today.

Here is a short description of the results under **Models** tab.

1. [**Models/Model 1**](Vignettes/PT_1.html): 

    - Cross-validation

    - 3527 speed observations
    
    - data as replicates

2. [**Models/Model 2**](Vignettes/PT_2.html): 

    - Cross-validation

    - all speed observations
    
    - data as replicates

3. [**Models/Model 3**](Vignettes/PT_3.html): 

    - Cross-validation

    - all and some speed observations
    
    - data as a whole

4. [**Models/Model 4**](Vignettes/PT_4.html): 

    - Cross-validation

    - all and some speed observations
    
    - data as replicates (this is the only difference with Model 3)
    
5. [**Models/Model 5**](Vignettes/PT_5.html): 

    - No cross-validation
    
    - data as replicates
    
    - `sf_graph$add_observations(data = data, group = "day", clear_obs = TRUE)`
    
6. [**Models/Model 6**](Vignettes/PT_6.html): 

    - No cross-validation
    
    - data as replicates
    
    - `sf_graph$add_observations(data = data, group = "day", normalized = TRUE, clear_obs = TRUE)` **This is the only difference with Model 5. Conclussion: Adding normalized = TRUE` does not make any difference. Explanation: See [**Tips/Tip 1**](Vignettes/Nuances/N1.html).**
    
    
7. [**Models/Model 7**](Vignettes/PT_7.html): 

    - INLA implementation
    
    - data as replicates
    
8. [**Models/Model 8**](Vignettes/PT_8.html): 

    - `start.theta = theta.prior.mean = c(fit.rspde$summary.log.std.dev$mode, fit.rspde$summary.log.range$mode, rep(0, (ncol(B.sigma)-3)))`
    
    - data as replicates
    
9. [**Models/Model 9**](Vignettes/PT_9.html): 

    - `sf_graph$edgeweight_to_data()` is used directly in this file.

    - `start.theta = theta.prior.mean = c(fit.rspde$summary.log.std.dev$mode, fit.rspde$summary.log.range$mode, rep(0, (ncol(B.sigma)-3)))`
    
    - data as replicates
    
    -
